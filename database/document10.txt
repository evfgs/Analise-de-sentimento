Continuous material space in the nondual field physics of Einstein and Infeld replaces the assumed emptiness between point particles in the Newton model of reality. The elementary kinetic mass-energy of circular metric flows originates due to the exact compensation by their negative self-gravitation energy. The Einstein equation analog for nonequilibrium field densities of moving nondual matter results in the vector geodesic relations for metric mass-energy flows that modifies the Navier-Stocks equation by the 1738 Bernoulli potential.
